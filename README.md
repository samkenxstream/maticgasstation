## Usage

Send HTTP GET request

To get recommendations using v1

```bash
curl -s localhost:7000/v1 | jq
```

To get recommendations using v2

```bash
curl -s localhost:7000/v2 | jq
```

The following way to request is **deprecated**. Please change older code to request using the above versioned endpoints (Changed to v1)

```bash
# deprecated use (Use v1 endpoint instead for same results)
curl -s localhost:7000 | jq
```

You'll receive

```json
{
  "safeLow": 2,
  "standard": 3.020000001,
  "fast": 5,
  "fastest": 3870.208681652,
  "sinceLastBlock": 2,
  "lastBlockNumber": 15854458
}
